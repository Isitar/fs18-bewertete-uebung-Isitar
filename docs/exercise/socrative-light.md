# Socrative-light

A possible project idea: a light version of http://www.socrative.com.

## Possible Workflow

- Lecturer enters question
- Lecturer enters available answers
- Students choose answers
- Everybody can see report about answers

## Constraints

Questions are plain text.

Answers can be simple yes/no, a fixed number of choices,
or (optional) a flexible number of choices.
 
Reports tell which answer has been chosen how often.
This can be done in a list, a table, or a histogram.

## Not in scope

- no user management, no login, no security
- no authentication, no authorization
- no correction of previous submissions
- no protection against double-submissions
